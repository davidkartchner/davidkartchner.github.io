  This work presents a new, original document classification dataset, BioSift, to expedite the initial selection and labeling of studies for drug repurposing.  The dataset consists of 10,000 human-annotated abstracts from scientific articles in PubMed.  Each abstract is labeled with up to eight attributes necessary to perform meta-analysis utilizing the popular patient-intervention-comparator-outcome (PICO) method:  has human subjects, is clinical trial/cohort, has population size, has target disease, has study drug, has comparator group, has a quantitative outcome, and an "aggregate" label.  Each abstract was annotated by 3 different annotators (i.e., biomedical students) and randomly sampled abstracts were reviewed by senior annotators to ensure quality.  Data statistics such as reviewer agreement, label co-occurrence, and confidence are shown.  Robust benchmark results illustrate neither PubMed advanced filters nor state-of-the-art document classification schemes (e.g., active learning, weak supervision, full supervision) can efficiently replace human annotation.  In short, BioSift is a pivotal but challenging document classification task to expedite drug repurposing.  The full annotated dataset is publicly available and enables research development of algorithms for document classification that enhance drug repurposing.

Identifying disease comorbidities and grouping medical diagnoses into disease incidents are two important problems in health care delivery and assessment. 
Using vector space embeddings produced using the Global Vectors (GloVe) algorithm, we are able to find useful vector representations of diagnosis codes that can identify related diagnoses and thus improve identification of related disease incidents.
